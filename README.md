# nnSVG-analyses

This repository contains code scripts to reproduce analyses and figures in our paper "nnSVG: scalable identification of spatially variable genes using nearest-neighbor Gaussian processes".


## nnSVG

`nnSVG` is a method for scalable identification of spatially variable genes (SVGs) in spatially-resolved transcriptomics data.

`nnSVG` is available as an R package from [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/nnSVG) and [GitHub](https://github.com/lmweber/nnSVG).

More details including installation instructions and a tutorial are available on the [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/nnSVG) and [GitHub](https://github.com/lmweber/nnSVG) pages.


## Contents

The code in this repository is organized into subdirectories in the [analyses/](analyses/) directory.
